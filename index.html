            <p>
                Here, I let you know about my interests and history.
                My tech journey actually started way longer that I realized. Those days (in the days of windows mellennium edition) when I play games with enthusiasm on my brother's computers and out of curiosity began exploring the divers capacities and functionalities of a computer system
                At WorldQuant University (in the year 2019) I started learning about Data Science and Machine Learning (Nicholas C. Goodbody was my instructor then) using python as a programming tool.
                Today I have diversified into other tech field such as web development and video editing.
                Kindly go through my information in the other sections of this piece.

                        <P>

                            There at my local Church, Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, iyana-Ipaja, I have
                            used my knowledge of python programming for video editing and application development
                        </P>

                            Here, I have combined knowledge of python programming, PHP and JavaScript (of course, CSS and HTML included) to build functional webpages

                PROJECTS
            </p>
            <p>
                I have so many undeployed projects.<br>
                I however have 2 which can be easily assessed on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ebenEzekiel">GitHub <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span></a> 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>THE HISTORICAL WEATHER REPORTER <a href="https://ebenezekiel.github.io/WeatherApp/" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span></a> <br>
                    This is a JavaScript powered webapp that gives last 24 hours weather report of various cities; hence the name "Historical Weather Reporter".<br>
                    You may search for your favorite Nigerian cities too, to see what results you get
                </li>

                <li>THE DICTIONARY APP <a href="https://ebezekiel.github.io/DictionaryApp/" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span></a> <br>
                    This webapp fetches the meaning of English words, gives details of 
                    phonetics and has added pronounciation functionality. A really great app to try out<br>
